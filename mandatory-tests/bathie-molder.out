The input linear program is :

Maximize  5x_0 +9/2x_1
Such that 1x_0 +0x_1 <= 800
          3/50x_0 +1/20x_1 <= 60
          10x_0 +20x_1 <= 15000
          x_0, x_1 are non-negative

The linear program is FEASIBLE
An optimal solution is x_0 = 4500/7, x_1 = 3000/7
Optimal value : 36000/7
Number of pivots : 3
Pivot function used : Custom
